### Poisson regression

The AirCrash dataset in the vcdExtra package contains data on all fatal commercial airplane crashes from 1993â€“2015. [@vcdextra] How does the number of fatalities depend on other variables? Fit a main effects Poisson regression model. [@friendly2016]


```{r message=FALSE}
library(vcdExtra)
data("AirCrash")
```


### Rate model

The `esdcomp` data frame from the `faraway` package [@faraway] contains data on complaints about emergency room doctors. Data was recorded on 44 doctors working in an emergency service at a hospital to study the factors affecting the number of complaints received. Build a model for the _rate_ of complaints received. [@faraway_book] Use `visits` as an offset in the model.


```{r}
library(faraway)
data("esdcomp")
```
